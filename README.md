## Installing
Install [BeatSaberMarkupLanguage](https://github.com/monkeymanboy/BeatSaberMarkupLanguage) using one of the many available mod installers for Beat Saber or download the latest version from [BeatMods](https://beatmods.com/).

Install [the latest release of DynamicOpenVR](https://github.com/nicoco007/DynamicOpenVR/releases) by [following the instructions in the repository's README](https://github.com/nicoco007/DynamicOpenVR/blob/master/README.md#Installing).

Download [the latest release of Custom Avatars](https://github.com/nicoco007/BeatSaberCustomAvatars/releases) and extract **the entire contents** of the ZIP file into your Beat Saber folder (for Steam, this is usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber`), **overwriting any existing files**.

## Contributing
To automatically copy the compiled DLL into Beat Saber's installation directory, create a file called `CustomAvatar.csproj.user` next to `CustomAvatar\CustomAvatar.csproj` and paste in the following:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <!-- Replace this with the path to your Beat Saber installation -->
    <BeatSaberDir>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber</BeatSaberDir>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
